This Repo holds the changes that were suggested in https://github.com/containers/skopeo/issues/1601[this issue] and will do the following

take as envvar the:
- DIGEST: the docker image digest
- IMAGE_PREFIX: the prefix to search the image on (so we don't search all of the images
- IMAGE_NAME: the image name that we will query

TODO:
- make the check take the whole `FROM` Dockerfile line and parse the DIGEST && IMAGE_NAME from it.
